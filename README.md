# ProsperLoanInvestigation
Using data visualizations, I will investigate the Prosper Loan Data

# The Dataset
The Dataset contains 113,917 loans, each loan has information on each borrower's annual percentage rate (APR), status, borrowed amount, credit ratings, past delinquencies, etc... Variables with missing values were dropped to make the Dataset more cleaner and more accurate. This data set will be investigating which variables impact the borrowers loan APR. 

The dataset can be download here: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547358770029000

# Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to display the relationship of variales within the dataset using visualizations. With that purpose in mind, there was minimal data cleaning performed.

# Key Insights
After analyzing many variables; Borrowers's APR, Borrowers's score, rating, available bank card credit and creditscore were found to be negatively correlated to Borrower's APR. This can be seen in univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots. Also, borrowers with lower letter ratings, lack of home ownership and occupations with lower incomes tend to have higher APR's.
